Healing a planet cannot be done overnight. And maybe this is why we push off our responsibility to the next day, to the next person, to the next generation.
What we hope to convey is the necessity of long-term planning; of understanding that the solutions we seek are rooted in our actions today. Through rounds in which you are presented with tasks without explicitly being aware of a decaying world, you begin to notice the effects of your actions carry over and contribute to deterioration over time. You realize that the true issue, which results in your demise if played carelessly, is one that can only be avoided by making sustainable decisions from the start, even if those actions donâ€™t coincide with your day-to-day goals.
By sharing this message via a game, we present an opportunity for individuals to discover this lesson for themselves, and reflect on their contributions to a larger community. It is not the final solution, perhaps, but an important seed of inspiration.
